이는 각자 구분되는 투자 프로파일을 정립해 주력 분야가 명확한 비즈니스를 만들고자 하는 전략적 결정입니다.
이번 제안된 기업 분할을 통해 생기는 세 회사 모두 앞으로 고객에게 더 나은 서비스를 제공하고, 이해관계자에게 유리한 장기적
가치를 창출할 기회를 만들 수 있을 것으로 전망합니다. 이 과정은 공고 날짜로부터 완료되기까지 18~24개월이 소요될 것으로
예상됩니다. 우리는 이러한 전환과정에서 직원을 지원하면서, 원활하고 순조로운 분할 과정을 보장하고자 최선을 다하고 있습니다.
우리는 또 끊임없이 진화하는 우리 조직의 성장과 성공을 위해 함께할 새로운 인재 영입을 환영하며 기대하고 있습니다.

important note
If you would like to be a part of a premier multi-industrial company that is delivering sustainable solutions
that bring real purpose and value, of a company with collaborative spirit because it believes that we work
best when we work together as a team and values the diversity of thought, then DuPont is the company for you!

We are excited to share that on May 22, 2024, DuPont announced plans to separate(1) into three industry-leading,
independent publicly traded companies. This strategic move will create focused businesses with
distinct investment profiles. We believe the proposed separations will create opportunities for all three future
companies to better serve their customers and unlock long-term value for stakeholders.
This process is expected to take 18-24 months from the date of announcement to complete.
We are committed to supporting our employees throughout this transition and ensuring a smooth and
successful separation process. We look forward to welcoming new talent who are interested in contributing
to the continued success and growth of our evolving organization.
